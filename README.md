I typically begin by considering the main goal of the project and developing a wireframe or pseudo code while designing software. During this project, I gained new design abilities mainly in the area of 3D graphics. Prior to now, IÂ having never actually programmed assets, simply dabbled in 3D art using programs like Blender. I had never used OpenGL or coded 3D assets before this course.
In order to create the 3D scene, I followed the modules' instructions, rendering the object, the camera, the texture, and the lighting. I divide the programs I create into manageable chunks as I work on them, breaking down big projects into smaller ones.
Becoming a competent software developer with a focus on full-stack web development and mobile development requires knowledge of computer science.
